<h1>MIDIFresh </h1>

<p>Is a pocket DJ mixing console using MIDI over Bluetooth low energy. I use it with Traktor Pro 4 but it should work with almost any DJ software that allows MIDI Mappings for a controller. 
</p>
<p>
The project uses an Adafruit ESP32-S3 Reverse TFT Feather Microcontroller at the heart and then some simple 10k potentiometers for cross fader and knobs. The microcontroller board has some buttons built in which are also utilized. 
</p>


<p>
There are included .stl files to print the case my design is simple and a bit steam punk with the microcontroller on the external side.  Likely a nicer case could be produced.

<h3>Parts List. </h3>
<pre>
3 X 10k rotary potentiometer. (linear) 
1 X 10k slider/fader type potentiometer (linear) 
Adafruit ESP32-S3 Reverse TFT Feather â€“ 4MB 
3 plastic knobs
1 plastic fader knob. 
3.2v LIPO that will fit in the case. 
</pre>


<h3>Construction</h3>

<p>The case can be printed in 3 parts and superglued together. I glued in the fader, The knobs and fader should all be connected to analogue pins on the microcontroller with +3v and 0v connected to each side and the LIPO connected to the DC/Bat port. 
</p>

<p>
There are some simple adjustments that can be done in the code that allows the use of different pins. Should be self-explanatory.
